### Hello, 
I am a researcher/ professor at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (TUB) and the [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW)](https://www.leibniz-izw.de/de/start.html). I am passionate about wildlife, nature, landscapes and travelling, [D6](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/department-of-ecological-dynamics.html) (the Department of Ecological Dynamics I lead at IZW) and applied wildlife ecology! My research is focussed around population dynamics and distributions of mammals and birds and thematically deals with movement ecology, disease dynamics, urban ecology and conservation biology. My areas of expertise are ecological modelling, spatial statistics, individual-based modelling and animal telemetry.  

You will currently find everything related to my [research](https://ecological-dynamics-izw.com/team-2-population-dynamics/) and [teaching 'n theses](https://ecological-dynamics-izw.com/theses/) for TUB at our [department website](https://ecological-dynamics-izw.com/). To foster reproducibility and transparency in science, you will find code related to our publications and tools/ packages to make work life easier on our [Github pages](https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/EcoDynIZW). You might also want to follow our research news via [twitter](https://twitter.com/EcoDynIZW). Have fun!
