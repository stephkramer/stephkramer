### Hello, 
I am a researcher/ professor at [Technische Universit√§t Berlin (TUB)](https://www.tu.berlin/en/animecol) and the [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW)](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/start.html). I am passionate about wildlife, nature, photography and travelling :eagle: :mountain_snow: :camera: :world_map:, [D6](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/department-of-ecological-dynamics.html) (the Department of Ecological Dynamics I lead at IZW) and applied wildlife ecology! 
<br><br>
My research is focussed around 
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: population dynamics :globe_with_meridians: and distributions of :wolf: mammals and :bird: birds and thematically deals with 
* movement ecology, disease dynamics, urban ecology and conservation biology. My areas of expertise are ecological modelling, spatial statistics, individual-based modelling and animal telemetry.  

You will currently find everything related to my
