### Hello, 
I am a researcher/ professor at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (TUB) and the [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW)](https://www.leibniz-izw.de/de/start.html). I am passionate about wildlife, nature, landscapes and travelling, [D6](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/department-of-ecological-dynamics.html) (the Department of Ecological Dynamics I lead at IZW) and applied ecology! My research is focussed around wildlife ecology and thematically deals with movement ecology, disease dynamics, urban ecology and wildlife (carnivore) conservation. My area of expertise is ecological modelling, spatial statistics, individual-based modelling and animal telemetry.  

You will currently find everything related to my research and teaching at our [department website](https://ecological-dynamics-izw.com/). On our [Github pages](https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/EcoDynIZW), you will find code related to our publications and tools/ packages to make work life easier. You might also want to follow our research news via [twitter](https://twitter.com/EcoDynIZW). Have fun!
